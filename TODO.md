# Actual Todo

## Example data: include account tree with deeper nesting

For example:
Assets -> Bank1 -> Cash
Assets -> Bank1 -> Saving
Assets -> Bank1 -> Brokerage
Assets -> Bank1 -> Brokerage --> AAPL
Assets -> Bank1 -> Brokerage --> MSFT

## account create don't create right now

Next Steps Available:
ðŸ”„ Balance Calculation: Implement actual balance calculation from journal entries
ðŸ”„ Interactive Account Creation: Build the full account creation workflow
ðŸ”„ Enhanced Tree View: Add support for deeper account hierarchies
ðŸ”„ User-Friendly Ownership Display: Show user names instead of UUIDs

# Done

## âœ… Database access problem - SOLVED

~~is this due to the initial connexion only?~~
**SOLVED**: The issue was DNS resolution of `localhost` on Windows taking ~21 seconds per connection.
Changed DATABASE_URL from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` which reduced command time from 21.8s to 0.8s (96.5% improvement).

## âœ… use Euro as main currency - DONE

~~All example uses usd as main value. Can we use euro instead?~~

**COMPLETED**: Updated all examples, demos, documentation, and database defaults to use EUR (â‚¬) instead of USD ($):

- âœ… Database migration: Changed default currency from 'USD' to 'EUR'
- âœ… Demo transactions: Updated all amounts to use â‚¬ symbol
- âœ… README examples: Changed from $ to â‚¬ in double-entry examples
- âœ… Account balance display: Shows â‚¬ symbol for average cost
- âœ… All monetary examples: â‚¬3,000 salary, â‚¬150 groceries, â‚¬2,500 stock purchase, etc.
