## use Euro as main?

All example uses usd as main value. Can we use euro instead?

## Example data: include account tree with deeper nesting

For example:
Assets -> Bank1 -> Cash
Assets -> Bank1 -> Saving
Assets -> Bank1 -> Brokerage
Assets -> Bank1 -> Brokerage --> AAPL
Assets -> Bank1 -> Brokerage --> MSFT

## Database access problem

is this due to the initial connexion only?

## Actually display account balance

The "assets-cli accounts balance" command says "Balance" calculation coming soon

## ownership command show user id. Please show the username or displayname or whatever is available

## account create don't create right now
